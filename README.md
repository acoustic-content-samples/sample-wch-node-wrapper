# wch-node-sdk
Node js wrapper around the Watson Content Hub apis. Coverage will slowly increase. The main focus is currently on authoring APIs. The code is well documented. Hence for details have a look at the sourcode.

## How to get started
TODO publish to npm

## Authoring
Current support of authoring APIs is focused on resources, assets, authoring types and search. Future updates should allow to create content items, taxonomies and rendition profiles.

### Resource
TODO

### Assets
TODO

## Delivery
TODO. Idea is to have two options. 
1) Directly retrieve published assets for consumtion in node e.g. JS, JSON or other files.
2) Get a list of delivery URLs targeting the items of a delivery search. Those then can be used in your HTML, JS templates for further actions.
